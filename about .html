    <h3><b><u>Brief history</u></b></h3><!-- This is the brief history heading -->
    <p>Started by a young South African with the love for cars and the hate for scamming that is currently happening, trying to solve some of the car problems that one might be experiencing.</p>

    <h3><b><u>Mission</u></b></h3>
    <p>This website is based on car knowledge and fixing cars. The goal is to save people from being robbed by mechanics. The website is for people of all ages.</p>

    <h3><b><u>Vision</u></b></h3>
    <p>Here to help you understand your car and prevent getting scammed by people that you might trust and believe in.</p>
    <p>This website is meant to help your car perform better and have a real connection with your car.</p>

    <h3><b><u>Goal of the website</u></b></h3>
    <p><u>The goal is to reduce the number of times you go to your local spare parts shops.</u></p>
    <p>It also helps save time as all you need is to show them the part rather than going to the counter with the physical part. The website is also meant to help you order the part from the local spare shop.</p>
    <p>The website should also help you style your ride the way you wish with AI.</p>
